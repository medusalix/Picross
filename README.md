Picross is a logic puzzle game originally invented by Japanese puzzler [Tetsuya Nishio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#History) and popularised by [Nintendo's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) _**Pic**ture **Cross**word_ titles.
This project serves as an example of a simple Picross clone using standard **WPF components** and little custom styling.

## How to play

<img src="howto.gif" alt="How to" align="right">

- Every row and column has to have a **certain amount of crosses**
- The **numerical hints** on each side indicate the number of **consecutive crosses** there have to be in each row/column
- Every group of crosses must be kept **separate from the subsequent sequence**
- The goal is to fill out the grid completely using the hints provided
- Crosses can be **placed using a left click**, fields can be **excluded by right clicking**
- Successive boxes can be marked by **holding the mouse button and dragging** across the grid
